# AirBnB_Dashboard



Through careful analysis and visualization, I've brought to life the data that helps to inform Airbnb's business decisions. My goal was to create a dashboard that was not only informative but also visually stunning.

Using Tableau, I created a variety of charts and graphs that beautifully illustrate trends and patterns within the data. From heat maps to scatter plots, each visualization provides a unique perspective on Airbnb's business operations.

As a data analyst, I believe that the power of data lies in its ability to tell a story. Through this dashboard, I've been able to weave together the narrative of Airbnb's success and growth, while also highlighting areas for improvement and potential opportunities.
